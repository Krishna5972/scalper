Find the coin that recently did a extended shortterm gain/loss and hope for it to make a flag...



Entry is retrace, tup is not trend change, instead a limit order of initial upperband, and sl being longterm trend change

position sizing depends on 15m long term



Buy : {


   'limitOrderPirce' :  'orderID' 
}

sell : {

    'limitOrderPirce' :  'orderID' 
}

if currentPrice > 'limitOrderPirce':
    cancel that limit order



    Checks

Short Term change Sell in Long Term

TP placed at lowerband of short term buy  Done
Dca at 1.4  Done

if TP is reached is DCA order getting canclled Done

IF trend changed before tp, should still be in position,  Done

but the dca order with respect to the trend should be cancelled, but tp order should profit qty should increase
